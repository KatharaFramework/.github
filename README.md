# Kathará Framework

Welcome to the Kathará Framework on GitHub! Kathará is a network emulator designed for networking education, research and testing. Our aim is to provide a flexible and practical environment for testing, experimenting, and learning about computer networks.

## About Kathará Framework

**Kathará** (from the Greek Καθαρά, _purely_) is a lightweight network emulation system based on Docker containers.
It can be really helpful in showing interactive demos/lessons, testing production networks in a sandbox environment, or developing new network protocols and technologies.

Kathará is the spiritual successor of the notorious [Netkit](https://www.netkit.org/), hence it is cross-compatible, and inherits its language and features.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects hosted under the KatharaFramework organization:

- [Kathará](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara): The core framework that powers network emulation.
- [Docker Images](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Docker-Images): Docker images that provide specialized suites for different network scenarios.
- [Kathará Labs](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara-Labs): Collection of the official Kathará network scenarios, tutorials and exercises.
